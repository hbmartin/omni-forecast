# grounded-weather-forecast

Station-grounded blending of multi-provider weather forecasts: bias correction,
anchoring, and blending judged by a rolling-origin backtest leaderboard.

grounded-weather-forecast turns two SQLite files — a personal weather station's minute-level
observation log ([ambientweather2sqlite](https://github.com/hbmartin/ambientweather2sqlite))
and a multi-provider forecast archive
([omni-weather-forecast-apis](https://github.com/hbmartin/omni-weather-forecast-apis)) —
into three forecast products for one location:

- **next hour, by minute** — an anchored nowcast blending the live station reading into
  the hourly blend, plus native minutely precipitation where providers supply it
- **next day, by hour**
- **next 10 days, by day**

## How it works

Three composable stages. Nothing ships because it sounds good — a stage is used
for a given variable and lead time only if it wins that slice on the backtest
leaderboard.

1. **Grounding** — per-source correction toward the station, fitted per
   variable × lead bucket. Most providers repackage the same global models, so
   their *shared* bias is invisible to any weighting scheme; only correction
   removes it. A bias correction by default — the slope is opt-in, for reasons
   the data taught us (see [ADR 0004](https://hbmartin.github.io/grounded-weather-forecast/adr/0004-grounding-defaults-to-bias-only/)).
2. **Blending** — combining grounded sources: equal weight, trimmed mean
   (drops the extremes per row — robustness with zero parameters),
   inverse-MSE and inverse-MAE weighting, gradient-boosted stacking, and
   online expert aggregation with sleeping experts (ragged provider horizons
   need no special casing) and fixed share (so a provider that silently swaps
   its backend model loses weight in days). Grounding also comes in a
   MAE-consistent median-intercept variant.
3. **Anchoring** — short-lead correction toward the latest live observation,
   decaying exponentially with lead. Your thermometer is the one input no
   provider has.

Ground truth is QC'd (plausibility bounds, spike and flatline filters) and
aggregated from minute data. Scoring uses MAE/RMSE/bias, CRPS, and
Brier/reliability for precipitation probability, with Diebold–Mariano
significance per variable × lead bucket, under strict rolling-origin splits.
Live and synthetic (backfilled) data are never pooled.

## Installation

grounded-weather-forecast requires Python 3.13 or newer. Install the command in an isolated
environment with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
uv tool install grounded-weather-forecast
grounded-weather-forecast --version
```

## Usage

Download the [example configuration](https://github.com/hbmartin/grounded-weather-forecast/blob/main/config.example.toml),
save it as `config.toml`, and point it at your two SQLite files, coordinates,
and elevation:

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hbmartin/grounded-weather-forecast/main/config.example.toml \
  -o config.toml
```

```bash
# 1. Inspect the station truth: per-channel bounds/spike/flatline flag counts
#    and hourly/daily coverage after QC.

# 2. Optional: poll the Open-Meteo Ensemble API before building matrices.
#    Real ensemble spread becomes leakage-safe ens__* feature columns. Run
#    this once per model cycle; configure [ensembles].models.
grounded-weather-forecast ingest-ensembles              # --models <ids>

# 3. Materialize truth tables, canonical long frames, and the supervised
#    hourly/daily matrices as parquet + manifest.json under [dataset].dir.
#    Re-run this after every ensemble ingest before backtesting or serving.
grounded-weather-forecast build-dataset

# 4. Optional cold start. A forecast archive is only useful once it holds months
#    of stored *vintages*, so a new one can say nothing yet. Open-Meteo's
#    Previous Runs API backfills real archived forecasts (leads of exactly 1-7
#    days) for open NWP models, tagged `synthetic` and never pooled with live.
grounded-weather-forecast backfill --end 2026-07-12   # --models, --chunk-days

#    A second backfill provider reads dynamical.org's free Zarr archives of
#    FULL forecast cycles (GEFS since 2020, AIFS-ENS since 2025-07) at native
#    3-6h steps — populating the sub-24h lead buckets Previous Runs cannot.
#    For an installed CLI, put the extra in that same tool environment:
uv tool install --force 'grounded-weather-forecast[backfill]'
grounded-weather-forecast backfill --provider dynamical --start 2026-06-01
#    From a checkout instead:
#    uv sync --extra backfill
#    uv run grounded-weather-forecast backfill --provider dynamical --start 2026-06-01

# 5. Study whether each hourly variable should use instantaneous or interval-mean
#    truth. Misalignment masquerades as provider bias; this measures it.

# 6. Rolling-origin backtest. Identified evaluation runs land in
#    [dataset].dir/scores without overwriting other windows/runs.
grounded-weather-forecast backtest --source live       # or --source synthetic
#   --methods all|<ids>  --products hourly,daily  --window expanding|rolling
#   --hourly-variables ...  --daily-variables ...  --semantics auto|inst|mean

# 6b. Optional: cross-check station truth against lapse-adjusted Synoptic
#    neighbors (free-signup token) and fit the radiation-shield error model.
#    A drifting or decorrelating sensor alarms here before it poisons truth.
grounded-weather-forecast truth-qc                      # --days 30

# 7. Leaderboards (per-slice skill with Diebold-Mariano, aggregate, winners,
#    absolute error, consumer %-within-3F), the provider error-correlation
#    matrix, and self-verification of forecasts this system actually served.
#    Also writes reports/dashboard.html — a fully offline, self-contained
#    operator console (seven zones: liveness, data trust, learning
#    readiness, evaluation, model internals, serving, explainability) with
#    threshold alerts sourced from the existing config knobs.
grounded-weather-forecast report

# 8. Emit the current blended forecast (minutely + hourly + daily) as JSON.
#    Every emitted forecast carries ready/degraded status and release identity,
#    and is appended atomically to a history so it can later be scored
#    against the truth that arrives — backtest skill is an estimate, this is the
#    measurement.
grounded-weather-forecast predict                      # to stdout
grounded-weather-forecast predict --out forecast.json
#   --method auto|<id>   --now <iso>   --no-history   --semantics ...
```

Every command takes `--config <path>` (default `config.toml`). Once that
configuration loads successfully, the invocation appends one row to
`[dataset].dir/runs.parquet` — a rolling ledger (command, timing, exit
status, dataset/config fingerprints) that the dashboard renders as the pipeline
heartbeat, kept to the last 90 days and 50,000 rows so it stays bounded under a
scheduled cadence. Parser and configuration-loading failures cannot be recorded
because the ledger destination comes from that configuration. Each `predict` run
additionally snapshots the fitted models' internals (grounding coefficients,
expert weights, GBM importances, anchoring decay) into
`[artifacts].dir/observability/` for the dashboard's glass-box zone, reclaiming
snapshot trees superseded by a newer dataset fingerprint; snapshot failures
never affect serving.

## Status

Alpha, and honest about it: with a young forecast archive the backtest reports
that it has no folds rather than inventing a leaderboard, and `predict` refuses
to serve from stale provider data rather than guessing.
