"""Physical truth-QC: the radiation-shield error model.

Daytime error of a passively ventilated radiation shield is well modeled as
increasing with solar load and decreasing with ventilation — the classic
``S / (1 + u)`` regressor (Nakamura-Mahrt form): 1-3 °C of spurious warmth
at high sun and calm wind is typical for consumer shields. The station has a
co-located anemometer, and top-of-atmosphere irradiance from the solar module
is the load proxy, so the signature is directly fittable:

- a significant positive slope means sunny-calm readings run warm *relative
  to the residual baseline* — a shield conversation;
- a slope that grows across refits is the failing-shield trajectory;
- the fitted curve doubles as a correction *candidate* and an
  observation-error inflation signal for anchoring. Neither is auto-applied:
  truth is never silently adjusted (the project's own rule).

Gauge catch-efficiency adjustment (WMO-SPICE transfer functions) is
deliberately deferred: the published coefficients must be transcribed from
Kochendorfer et al. (2018, HESS 22) with care, and the sample archive has
essentially no precipitation to validate against yet.
