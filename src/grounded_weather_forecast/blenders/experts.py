"""Online expert aggregation: EWA and BOA with sleeping experts and fixed share.

The experts are the grounded sources. Weights update sequentially in
training-row order, separately per lead bucket, because skill orderings differ
by horizon. Two mechanisms make this family the drift specialist of the lineup:

- **Sleeping experts.** A source outside its horizon is simply absent from the
  round: it is neither updated nor penalized, because the reduction assigns a
  sleeping expert the awake mixture's loss, i.e. an update factor of exactly
  one. Ragged provider horizons need no special casing.
- **Fixed share.** After each multiplicative update, a small fraction of the
  awake mass is redistributed uniformly. This floors every expert's weight and
  bounds the weight ratio. Without it the learning rate decays, an expert that
  dominated early accumulates an insurmountable lead, and the aggregator cannot
  follow a regime change — a provider silently swapping its backend model would
  keep its weight forever. With it, the weights track the best *sequence* of
  experts, and recovery takes days rather than never.

``ewa`` uses a known-horizon exponential update. ``boa`` (Bernstein Online
Aggregation) uses a second-order update whose per-expert rate shrinks with
accumulated regret variance, so it adapts faster when losses are volatile.
