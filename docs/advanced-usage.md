## Cold start: backfilling a synthetic archive

A forecast archive cannot be reconstructed after the fact — with one exception.
Open-Meteo's **Previous Runs API** serves archived forecasts at fixed day
offsets: `temperature_2m_previous_day3` is what the model predicted for *this*
valid hour, three days earlier. That is a real forecast archive with lead as a
controlled variable, and it can be fetched today.

The Open-Meteo provider interprets `--start` and `--end` as inclusive
**valid dates**. The dynamical provider interprets them as inclusive forecast
**initialization dates**. Install the latter from a checkout with
`uv sync --extra backfill`, or install the published
`grounded-weather-forecast[backfill]` extra.

```toml
[backfill.open_meteo]
models = ["ecmwf_ifs025", "gfs_seamless", "icon_seamless"]
start_date = 2025-06-15         # no earlier than your station truth begins
```

```bash
grounded-weather-forecast backfill --end 2026-07-12
# backfilled 198072 forecast points
# sources: open_meteo_ecmwf_ifs025, open_meteo_gfs_seamless, open_meteo_icon_seamless
# synthetic matrix: 66024 rows -> data/hourly_matrix_synthetic.parquet
```

Then backtest against it exactly as you would against live data:

```bash
grounded-weather-forecast backtest --source synthetic --products hourly,daily
grounded-weather-forecast report
```

### What backfilled data is good for — and what it is not

| Good for | Not valid for |
|---|---|
| Validating the entire pipeline end-to-end **today**. | Any conclusion about commercial providers (Google, Tomorrow.io, …) — they cannot be backfilled. |
| Ranking methods at 24–240 h leads with real skill numbers. | **Leads under 24 h.** Previous Runs offsets are whole days, so those buckets are empty. |
| Measuring provider error correlation and effective ensemble size. | Evaluating **anchoring**, which needs a short-lead row to compute the residual. |
| Fitting grounding coefficients for open NWP models. | Choosing a serving method for your *live* provider set. |

The day-0 (unsuffixed) Previous Runs field is **deliberately not requested**: for
a past hour it returns the *latest* run, whose effective lead is near zero.
Including it would fill the short-lead buckets with what is essentially an
analysis and make anchoring look miraculous. Its absence is why the short-lead gap
above cannot be papered over.

Synthetic and live rows are stored in separate files, tagged `source_kind`, and
any attempt to pool them raises `MixedProvenanceError`. This is deliberate: a
leaderboard built on three NWP models says nothing about eight consumer APIs.

Flags: `--models` (override the config list), `--start` (override the configured
valid-date start), `--chunk-days` (default 90 —
requests are chunked to keep URLs and responses sane), `--end` (default:
yesterday).

## Driving the backtest

```bash
grounded-weather-forecast backtest \
    --source live|synthetic \
    --products hourly,daily \
    --methods all \
    --hourly-variables temp_c,wind_speed_ms,pop \
    --window expanding \
    --semantics auto
```

### `--window expanding` vs `rolling`

Two different questions:

- **expanding** — "what does the system know, given everything it has ever seen?"
  Trains from the archive start to each fold origin.
- **rolling** — "what has it learned *lately*?" Trains on a fixed trailing window
  (`[backtest].rolling_window_days`, default 180).

Run both. If rolling wins, your providers are drifting or your training window is
seasonally unrepresentative — and that is exactly the condition under which a
free-slope grounding correction becomes dangerous
([ADR 0004](adr/0004-grounding-defaults-to-bias-only.md)).

!!! note "Rolling needs a dense archive"
    With a gappy station record, a 180-day rolling window can contain *zero*
    scoreable rows and the fold is skipped. On the sample data this makes rolling
    uninformative — see [Limitations](limitations.md#2-the-station-has-holes).

### `--semantics auto|inst|mean`

Whether a provider's "14:00 temperature" means *at* 14:00 or the *mean over*
14:00–15:00. Providers do not document it, and guessing wrong manufactures ~1 °C
of fake bias.

```bash
grounded-weather-forecast alignment
# recommended: {'temp_c': 'inst', 'humidity_pct': 'mean', 'dew_point_c': 'inst', ...}
# wrote artifacts/alignment.json
```

`alignment` correlates every source's forecasts against *both* truth definitions
and writes one canonical recommendation per variable. `--semantics auto` (the
default) applies each variable's own recommendation; `inst`/`mean` force one. The
study needs ≥72 overlapping rows per source×variable to make a call, and reports
`null` rather than guessing when it cannot.

### `--methods`

Run `grounded-weather-forecast backtest --methods all` to sweep every
registered method; the current roster groups as:

```
persistence  climatology  best_provider  equal_weight        <- baselines (the floor)
grounded_equal_weight  grounded_median_equal_weight
affine_equal_weight  inverse_mae  inverse_mse
trimmed_mean  grounded_trimmed_mean                          <- grounding + weighting
ewma_grounded_equal_weight  ewma_inverse_mae
harmonic_grounded_equal_weight                               <- drift-tracking grounding
anchored_grounded_equal_weight  anchored_inverse_mse
anchored_fitted_grounded  anchored_fitted_ewma
anchored_trend_grounded                                      <- + short-lead anchoring
gbm                                                          <- the nonlinear ceiling
ewa  boa                                                     <- online experts
emos  idr  conformal_gew  conformal_ewma                     <- distributional heads
```

`available_methods()` is the authority; this list is a reading aid, not a
contract.

`--methods all` runs everything (recommended — the baselines are the point). Or
name a subset: `--methods gbm,equal_weight,best_provider`.

---

## Reading the leaderboard properly

`reports/leaderboard_hourly_*.md` has four sections. The one that matters is the
per-slice board:

| lead_bucket | method_id | n | mae | bias | skill_vs_best_provider | dm_p_vs_best_provider |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 24-48h | gbm | 752 | 1.288 | **+0.119** | **+0.160** | **0.023** |
| 24-48h | equal_weight | 752 | 1.336 | +0.012 | +0.129 | 0.048 |
| 24-48h | affine_equal_weight | 752 | 1.471 | **+0.559** | +0.041 | 0.639 |
| 24-48h | best_provider | 752 | 1.534 | −0.983 | — | — |

**Read the columns in this order:**

1. **`n`** — how many paired samples. A slice with n = 40 is a rumour, not a
   result. It is printed first for a reason.
2. **`skill_vs_best_provider`** — `1 − MAE/MAE_ref`. Positive means you beat the
   best single provider. Also reported against grounded equal-weight, because "we
   beat the *worst* provider" is not a claim worth making.
3. **`dm_p_vs_...`** — the Diebold–Mariano p-value: **is this difference real?**
   It uses a Bartlett HAC variance (consecutive multi-hour forecast errors are
   serially correlated, and the naive variance is far too small) and the
   Harvey–Leybourne–Newbold small-sample correction. `p = 0.639` on
   `affine_equal_weight` above means: that 4% "skill" is noise.
4. **`bias`** — the mean error. **Do not skip this column.** A method with
   unremarkable MAE and a large bias is *systematically and correctably* wrong —
   and it is exactly this column that exposed grounding injecting a +1.4 °C warm
   bias ([Limitations §4.1](limitations.md#41-grounding-was-making-forecasts-worse)).

Also in the report: `pct_within` (a consumer-legible "within 3 °F" rate), `brier`
for PoP, an **error-correlation matrix** across providers (which tells you how
many *effective* independent sources you really have), and — once you have served
forecasts — a **self-verification** section.

---

## Serving

```bash
grounded-weather-forecast predict --out forecast.json
```

| flag | effect |
|---|---|
| `--method <id>` | Force one method for every slice, ignoring the leaderboard. Useful for A/B'ing. |
| `--now <iso>` | Return the exact archived document if that instant was served; otherwise reconstruct causally using only evidence available then. If that release's implementation is unavailable, emit an explicit degraded equal-weight forecast. |
| `--no-history` | Do not append to the self-verification history. |
| `--semantics` | As for `backtest`. |
| `--out -` | stdout (default). |

Method selection resolves in this order:

```
[predict.methods] config pin   ->   per-slice backtest winner   ->   named fallback
```

Only live scores matching the current configuration, source set, truth semantics,
code identity, and requested issue time are promotable. Dataset fingerprints are
intentionally not used as a promotable-cohort key. Recent live verdicts are pooled
only across releases whose configuration, selected method, implementation identity,
provider source set, exact serving feature schema, and per-variable truth semantics
all match. The cold-start fallback is fit-free
`equal_weight`; the document is marked `status = "degraded"` and records the reason.
**It never presents an unfitted grounded method as trained.**

Pin a method when you have a reason to override the leaderboard:

```toml
[predict.methods]
"hourly.temp_c" = "gbm"
"daily.temp_max_c" = "grounded_equal_weight"
```

### The self-verification loop

Every served forecast is archived as an exact JSON document and appended under a
file lock to `data/predict_history.parquet`. Later, when product-specific minute,
hourly, or daily truth arrives, `report` scores it:

```
## Self-verification (served vs realized)

| product | variable | method_id | n | live_mae | live_rmse | live_bias | backtest_mae | mae_gap |
| hourly  | temp_c   | grounded_equal_weight | 45 | 1.206 | 1.477 | -0.335 | 1.775 | -0.569 |
```

**Why this matters:** backtest skill is an *estimate* of live skill. `mae_gap` is
the difference between what the backtest promised and what actually happened. A
large positive gap means the serving path has quietly diverged from the
backtested one — a class of bug that a backtest, by construction, can never catch
on its own.

This section is attached **only** to the live leaderboard, because comparing
live-provider forecasts against a synthetic-source backtest would be
apples-to-oranges.

---

## Tuning

All of these are code constants with deliberate defaults. Change them knowing
what they trade.

### Grounding slope (`blenders/grounding.py`)

```python
AffineGrounding(slope_shrinkage=0.0)   # 0.0 = bias-only  (default)
                                       # 1.0 = free least-squares slope
                                       # b = 1 + λ·(b_ols − 1)
```

The default is bias-only for a measured reason
([ADR 0004](adr/0004-grounding-defaults-to-bias-only.md)). Both variants are on
the leaderboard (`grounded_equal_weight` vs `affine_equal_weight`) — **let the
data tell you** when your archive is seasonally representative enough to earn the
slope back. Watch `affine_equal_weight`'s `bias` column: while it is large and
positive, the slope is not earning anything.

### Fixed share (`blenders/experts.py`)

```python
_SHARE = 0.005     # the drift-vs-average-case knob
```

The loser's steady-state weight is roughly `share / (2 · learning rate)`. Raising
it adapts faster to a provider swapping its model, at the cost of permanently
carrying weight on a worse expert. The sweep that produced 0.005 is in
[Limitations §4.2](limitations.md#42-the-online-experts-could-not-adapt-to-drift);
0.02 cost 24–30% average-case MAE for no benefit.

### Anchoring decay (`blenders/anchoring.py`)

```python
TAU_GRID_HOURS = (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 6.0, 12.0, 24.0)
_ANCHOR_MAX_LEAD = 3.0     # a snapshot needs a row under 3h to have an anchor
_WEIGHT_FLOOR = 0.05       # below this the correction is zeroed
```

`τ` is fitted per variable by grid search, and **"no anchoring" is on the grid** —
so if the residual carries no signal, anchoring degrades exactly to its base
blend rather than adding noise.

### GBM (`blenders/gbm.py`)

`objective: regression_l1` (we score MAE, so we train MAE), 300 rounds, lr 0.05,
31 leaves, fixed seed, `deterministic: true`. Features: grounded source values,
lead, hour-of-day, month, source ages, issue-time observation, ensemble spread,
count of available sources. **Do not add a truth-derived feature** — the
`ForecastMatrix` contract will raise, and the poisoning sentinel will fail.

### Lead buckets (`leads.py`)

```
0-1h  1-3h  3-6h  6-12h  12-24h  24-48h  48-96h  96-168h  168-240h  240h+
D1  D2  D3-4  D5-7  D8-10
```

Quasi-logarithmic (error grows that way), with edges on the provider raggedness
cliffs (24/48/168/240 h — where providers' horizons actually end). `leads.py` is
the single source of truth: change it there and every fit, every score and every
report follows. Fewer buckets = more data per bucket but less lead resolution.

### QC thresholds (`[qc]` in config)

`[qc]` bounds the **station** (truth) channels:

```toml
[qc.bounds]
temp = [-40.0, 55.0]          # metric units, per canonical channel
[qc.max_step]
temp = 4.0                    # per minute; scales with the actual sample gap
[qc.flatline_minutes]
temp = 180                    # a run of identical values this long is a stuck sensor
```

### Provider plausibility QC (`[provider_qc]` in config)

`[provider_qc]` bounds the **provider** (forecast) values *before* grounding, so a
mislabelled or garbage value (a snow depth in a liquid field, a pressure in the
wrong unit, one provider's daily low far colder than every peer) is nulled and
simply drops out of the availability mask rather than corrupting the fit. Two
conservative filters run; both are on by default.

```toml
[provider_qc]
enabled = true
mad_k = 5.0                   # cross-source outlier: null a value that disagrees
min_sources = 4              #   with peers at the same valid time by > mad_k scaled
                             #   MADs AND the per-variable floor, once >= min_sources
                             #   providers are present. Deliberately conservative so
                             #   genuine provider diversity is preserved.
[provider_qc.bounds]
pressure_sea_hpa = [850.0, 1090.0]   # absolute physical bounds, per canonical variable
[provider_qc.min_deviation]
pressure_sea_hpa = 20.0              # the absolute floor for the cross-source rule
```

Skewed/zero-inflated fields (precipitation, PoP, gusts) get absolute bounds only;
the cross-source rule applies to the roughly-Gaussian state variables listed in
`cross_source_variables`.

---

## Adding a blending method

A blender is anything satisfying the protocol. That is the whole interface:

```python
# src/grounded_weather_forecast/blenders/mine.py
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Self
import numpy as np

from grounded_weather_forecast.blenders.grounding import AffineGrounding
from grounded_weather_forecast.blenders.protocol import finalize_point, masked_average
from grounded_weather_forecast.blenders.registry import register
from grounded_weather_forecast.contracts import (
    BlendResult, ForecastMatrix, SupervisedSlice, TargetKind,
)


@dataclass
class MedianBlend:
    method_id: str = "median"
    _kind: TargetKind = TargetKind.CONTINUOUS

    def fit(self, train: SupervisedSlice) -> Self:
        self._kind = train.variable.kind
        self._grounding = AffineGrounding().fit(train)   # compose the stages
        return self

    def predict(self, x: ForecastMatrix) -> BlendResult:
        corrected = self._grounding.transform(x)
        point = np.nanmedian(corrected, axis=1)          # NaN = unavailable source
        return BlendResult(point=finalize_point(point, self._kind))


register("median", MedianBlend)
```

Then add the import to `blenders/__init__.py`. That's it — it now appears in
`--methods all`, gets backtested, can win slices, and can be selected by
`predict`.

**Four rules the protocol enforces:**

1. **Renormalize over available sources.** `x.availability` is a `(n, k)` bool
   array; `masked_average` and `renormalize_weights` in `blenders/protocol.py` do
   this correctly. A method that assumes all sources are present will produce
   garbage the first time a provider is late.
2. **Never touch truth in `predict`.** `x.features` cannot contain truth columns
   (the contract raises), and the poisoning sentinel will catch you if you find
   another route.
3. **`NaN` means "no opinion"**, not zero. The engine stores it as null and scores
   promotion candidates on one common-case mask, with coverage shown.
4. **Be constructible fresh.** The registry stores a *factory*; the engine builds a
   new instance per fold. Do not cache state on the class.

**Tests you get for free:** the protocol-compliance suite is parametrized over the
whole registry, so your method is automatically checked for output shape and for
invariance to a never-available source column.

**Tests you should write:** a *directional* one, on synthetic data where you know
the answer. `tests/conftest.py::synthetic_hourly_matrix` makes a sinusoidal
climate with known provider biases, known noise levels, and optional ragged
horizons:

```python
def test_median_resists_an_outlier_provider():
    matrix = synthetic_hourly_matrix(days=40, biases={"alpha": 20.0})  # alpha is broken
    train = to_supervised_slice(matrix, hourly_variable("temp_c"))
    median = get_factory("median")().fit(train).predict(train.x)
    mean   = get_factory("equal_weight")().fit(train).predict(train.x)
    assert mae(median.point, train.y) < mae(mean.point, train.y)
```

That is what the fixture is *for*: assertions about behaviour, not about shapes.

---

## Programmatic use

The CLI is a thin wrapper. Everything is importable:

```python
from pathlib import Path
import polars as pl

from grounded_weather_forecast.config import load_config
from grounded_weather_forecast.contracts import hourly_variable
from grounded_weather_forecast.dataset.matrix import to_supervised_slice, matrix_path
from grounded_weather_forecast.backtest.engine import BacktestRequest, run_backtest
from grounded_weather_forecast.reports.leaderboard import leaderboard, slice_winners
from grounded_weather_forecast.serve.predict import predict
from grounded_weather_forecast.serve.selection import select_methods

config = load_config(Path("config.toml"))

# a backtest
matrix = pl.read_parquet(matrix_path(config.dataset.dir, "hourly", "synthetic"))
scores = run_backtest(
    matrix,
    BacktestRequest(
        variables=(hourly_variable("temp_c"),),
        methods=("gbm", "equal_weight", "boa"),
        window="rolling",
    ),
    config,
)
print(slice_winners(leaderboard(scores)))

# a forecast
selections = select_methods(config, config.dataset.dir / "scores")
document = predict(config, selections)
print(document.to_json())
```

The scores frame is deliberately long and dumb — `method_id, variable, product,
source_kind, window, fold_origin, issue_time, valid_time, lead_hours, lead_bucket,
y_pred, y_true`. Every report is a `group_by` over it, so a *new* analysis costs a
polars expression, not a 45-fold re-run.

---

## The polling cron

Not part of this repo (it belongs to `omni-weather-forecast-apis`), but it
determines everything this system can ever learn.

**Recommended split:**

- **Hourly**, a diverse core: Open-Meteo with several *explicit* models
  (`ecmwf_ifs025`, `gfs_seamless`, `icon_seamless` — not just `best_match`), NWS,
  MET Norway, plus one or two commercial providers.
- **Every 6 hours**, everything else — this respects free-tier quotas, and the
  quota tracker will enforce them anyway.

**Diversity beats count.** This project measured an error correlation of ρ ≈ 0.51
across eight live providers, giving an *effective* ensemble of **1.8 independent
sources**. Adding a ninth provider that repackages GFS buys you almost nothing;
adding one with a genuinely different modelling stack buys you a lot.

The harness never assumes a uniform cadence — leads are always recomputed from
`fetched_at`, and the as-of snapshot logic means a 6-hourly provider is used at
its true age rather than being duplicated across hourly rows.

---

## Artifacts and reproducibility

The dataset build is byte-reproducible and records a **fingerprint** over the file
hashes:

```
dataset fingerprint: c5cdd0ee7777973f
```

Evaluation Runs and promoted Model Releases are stored with dataset, source-set,
semantics, window, code, and configuration identity. Several blenders also expose
serializable state through the artifact-store API, but serving currently refits from
the causally compatible matrix for a newly requested issue time.

Every emitted document is archived. `predict --now <its issued_at>` returns that
exact archived document; an issue time never served is reconstructed causally.

---

## Where the bodies are buried

Before you trust a number this system produces, read
**[Limitations](limitations.md)**. In particular:

- A young live archive can have too few snapshots for any live leaderboard. Synthetic
  NWP results never justify serving choices for commercial providers.
- Nothing under 24 h lead has been evaluated on real data, including the anchoring
  stage.
- The evaluation harness has already caught three real bugs — grounding *injecting*
  bias, the online experts being unable to adapt to drift, and a climatology
  baseline so broken it flattered everything measured against it. It will catch
  more. That is the point of it.
